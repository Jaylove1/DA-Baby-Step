# Project Name: DA-Baby-Step

# Project Objective: Problem Statement.
The challenge is identifying which product from the dataset offers the highest profitability for a seller looking to start production, while also considering countries with low manufacturing costs. The goal is to determine the most profitable product to focus on in each country where production expenses are minimal.

The project contains the financial sample dataset of some products and it is gotten from Mr Oyinbooke

# Data Transformation
It was observed that the dataset was well arranged but I also checked to confirm that there are no duplicate values or empty column 
in the dataset.
